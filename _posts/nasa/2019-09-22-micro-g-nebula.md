In September of 2017, 5 students including myself wrote a proposal to one of NASA Micro-g NExT challenges. These challenges are all set by NASA engineers on real problems they encounter while designing items for future space walks. RIT MMET Micro-g NExT team was challenged to develop, prototype and make a module leak repair device that can work in a microgravity environment. This device would be used if a module of the ISS is hit with debris that caused a small hole. My role on the team was Co-lead of the project. I oversaw all aspects of the device and made sure the project got done on time. 

This device must be manually operated, seal a hole from .5” to 1”, and withstand pressurization to atmospheric pressure. The solution to the proposed challenge is titled NEBULA, or Nullify Existing Breaches Utilizing a Labtobrical Assembly. It is a simple device that is actuated by twisting the top section until the device pulls together and seals the hole. The device was completely designed, manufactured and tested by the students on the team. This proposal was selected as one of the few to get manufactured and tested in the NBL in Houston Texas. 

During NBL testing, the device performed successfully and was given high amounts of praise by both NASA engineers present and the professional divers that used the device.
