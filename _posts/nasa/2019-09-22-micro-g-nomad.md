In September of 2016, 6 students including myself wrote a proposal to one of NASA Micro-g NExT challenges. These challenges are all set by NASA engineers on real problems they encounter while designing items for future space walks. RIT MMET Micro-g NExT team was challenged to develop, prototype and make a surface sampling device that can work in a microgravity environment. My role on the team was to help manage, design and write. 

The device must be manually operated, collect 9 in2 of particulate from a minimum distance of 18 inches, and store the sample preventing contamination between samples. The solution to the proposed surface sampling challenge is titled NOMAD, Non-terrestrial Object Manual Acquisition Device. It is a simple device that is dragged along the desired surface and collects sample when the operator pulls towards themselves. The trigger mechanism is all that is required to open the bottom door of the device to collect the sample. The device was completely designed, manufactured and tested by the students on the team. This proposal was selected as one of the few to get manufactured and tested in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, NBL, in Houston Texas. 

During NBL testing, the device performed well and was successful at meeting all the challenge deliverables, it exceeded the expected limitations/obstacles. When the divers were giving feedback they mainly stuck to compliments and small suggestions such as the overall length of the device. They liked the ergonomic design and ease of use the device provided for them. When operated properly, the device provided fulfilled the given requirements with minimal guidance required.
