This research involved the adherence of 2 acrylic materials with a specialized epoxy. My job was to tensile and compression test all the adhered parts to see if the epoxy worked on the given material. I completed all of the testing and data analysis for the project. This was the first research project I did as a lead researcher. This research partnered with a dentist at the University of Rochester.
