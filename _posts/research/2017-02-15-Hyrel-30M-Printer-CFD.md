The Hyrel 30M printer was one of the first printers used for research in the army. This printer has an open nozzle design which allows for easy manipulation and innovation. Me and one other student used this printer to look at the forces and pressures applied to a material while printing with an FDM nozzle. The project was both experimental and computational with a CFD, or computational fluid dynamics,  analysis to confirm the results of the experiment. This study was written as a controlled conference paper and was government funded.
