Lulzbot is a widely used FDM printer in industry and R&D (Research and Design). Lulzbot is unique because all printer head components are open source and mainly 3D printed. This allows for easy innovation and repair of any of their printing nozzles. The program used with the printer is Cura. All projects using Lulzbot were government funded. 

I aided in the design and manufacturing of a personalized Flexy-Dually extruder that consisted of one side FDM and the other side syringe extrusion. This extruder was designed from the existing Flexy-Dually that had both sides for FDM, one for regular filament and one for flexible filament. I also hand coded g-code for testing the functionality of the head. This project was government funded. 

There were many challenges that occurred for both the software and hardware in this project. Many of the software challenges were fixed with manual adjustment of the g-code exported from Cura. The hardware components were either fixed by redesigning the nozzle, or by calling the company and looking at the main circuit board.
