The main printer used for SLS printing is the Sintratec printer. I assisted with the assembly of the printer and was the lead on the operation of the printer. The main materials printed with the Sintratec were PA-12 and TPE; both of which are Sintratec brand materials. This printer was involved in 3 government funded projects.
