GMB, or granular material binding, is a general term to describe printers that deposit or sinter powder layer by layer to create a part. For this project, a custom printer was designed to deposit a liquid binder onto reactive powder to create an energetic part. My role was to aid a professor in design, assembly and operation of the printer. The g-code for the printer was run from a CNC board and therefore I hand coded each part. 
In the summer of 2018, the printer successfully produced its first print and proved the ability to use GMB to bind reactive powder.  The following years
