GMB, or granular material binding, is a general term to describe printers that deposit or sinter powder layer by layer to create a part. For this project, a custom printer was designed to deposit a liquid binder onto reactive powder to create an energetic part. My role was to aid a professor in design, assembly and operation of the printer. I also hand coded each part from g-code since it is a custom machine. 

In the summer of 2018, the printer successfully produced its first print and proved the ability to use GMB to bind reactive powder.  After this, the printer was fully funded and a second iteration is underway.
