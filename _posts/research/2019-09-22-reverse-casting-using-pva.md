PVA, or polyvinyl alcohol, is a common support material in FDM due to its solubility in water. For this project, a complicated part was printed with PVA in an FDM printer. This part was then submerged in epoxy and then water to dissolve the PVA. The remaining epoxy could then be used as a cast for another material. My role was to design and manufacture the part and holder and test the concept for the project. This project was government funded.
