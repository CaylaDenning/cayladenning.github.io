In the research lab I worked in at RIT, there are 3 LCD printers (Monoprice mini LCD, Kudo3D Bean, and Elegoo Mars) and one DLP printer (Kudo3D Titan 2HR). All of these were for a government funded project that involved the classification of different LCD and DLP printers for development in a new type of LCD printer. I learned each of the printers software as well as how to accurately print with each machine.
