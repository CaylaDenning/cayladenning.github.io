This research involved supercritical drying gels with liquid CO2. For this project, I assisted in the making of the gels as well as the supercritical drying step. Clean room access was granted to me by the school in order to make the gel. Once the gel is made, it is placed into a manuclave that is then sealed shut. CO2 is then released into the manuclave and pressurized into liquid. The gel then sits in the liquid for ~24 hours until it is hardened. Once the gel is removed from the tank it is durable and acts as a perfect insulator. 

The project ended when a microsized tube was coated with an aerogel to prove the gel can be used as insulation. This project was not funded and therefore was dropped because of all the other funded projects available.
