The TMJ, or temporomandibular joint, can be found at the end of a human jaw. This joint has surrounding cartilage that can deteriorate overtime causing pain. To better understand the joint, doctors at the University of Rochester wanted to know the forces applied to the joint when opening and closing the mouth. 

For ethical reasons, human heads were not used for testing. Therefore, sheep heads were placed in a tensile tester at different angles to find the maximum force applied to the TMJ when the sheep mouth is open and closed. Sheep heads were used instead because they have a similar TMJ structure to humans with less ethical backing. All sheep heads were collected from a local butcher. No sheep was killed specifically for the project. For this project, I assisted in the preparation and testing of the heads and analysed the resulting data.
