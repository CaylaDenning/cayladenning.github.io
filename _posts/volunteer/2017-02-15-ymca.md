I volunteered with the YMCA teen group in Rochester from 2017 to2018. Me and 3 other students were guest speakers once a month during my 3rd year at RIT. This experience allowed me to plan lessons and fun events for the teens there to learn about engineering. Some of the lessons I planned were the classic egg drop (pictured below), NASA trivia, bridge building, and mission control team building exercise. I loved being able to share my knowledge and passion for engineering to teenagers looking for assistance in what to pursue as a career.
