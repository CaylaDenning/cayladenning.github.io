RIT hosts a girls in steam fair once a year to encourage girls to join the steam career. I helped with this event my second and third year at RIT. The first time volunteering, I helped run a metals booth that showed the work students in my program do in the first metals lab required. The second booth I ran was for the NASA project I was working on the same year.
