Imagine RIT is an annual event that brings over 15,000 people to RITâ€™s campus. This event is a showcase for what students are working on at RIT that year. I volunteered my first and second year on campus and presented the NASA projects my third and fourth year at the festival (pictured below). Volunteering entailed helping people find buildings and exhibits as well as assisting in the set-up and take down of the event.
