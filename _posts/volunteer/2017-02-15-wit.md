Women in Technology is a club I participated in my first few years at RIT. This club empowered women and encouraged them to share their voice in an engineering field dominated by men. In this club, I participated in volunteer work for the college and helped out anyway I could. My favorite volunteer event from this club was the overnight program. This program paired highschool seniors to a college student and let them stay 1 day and night at the college. During this day, the high school student got to experience what it is like being at college and what the classwork looks like.
