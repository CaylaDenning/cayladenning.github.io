REACH Outreach is a week long work camp I participated in during high school. This camp helped people in a community fix their houses for free. Each year I was placed on a team of other highschool students and help fix roofs, paint walls, retile floors, and other household jobs the homeowner could otherwise not afford. This camp made me realize my love for bringing people together and helping others in a community.
