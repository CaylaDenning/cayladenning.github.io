  <p>
    Hello! I am Cayla Denning, a mechanical engineering graduate looking to expand experience in the engineering field. My interests are in environmentally conscious projects, with an emphasis in R&D, testing, and analysis. I am qualified by experience with prototype design, professional research projects and additive manufacturing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work with FDM, SLA, SLS, LCD, DLP, and GMB type printers. My main printers are the Lulzbot TAZ 6, Zmorph VX and Sintratec SLS. I have printed with PLA, ABS, TPU, PVA, PMMA, Copper, Sintratec powders, Peopoly resins, and many other custom made filaments, resins and powders. Although I love additive manufacturing research, my passion is in sustainable energy.
